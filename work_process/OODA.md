The OODA loop is the cycle observe–orient–decide–act, developed by military strategist and United States Air Force Colonel John Boyd.

Observe 

    Do you even know if there's a problem?
    First, gather intelligence.  Read the question, look at the situation, examine the area.Act
    It all depends on the nature of the task.  But gain information FIRST.

Orient
    Once you have gained information on the situation or task, you need to ask yourself "what
    is this information telling me?"  The basic thought pattern is "What is the critical objective that needs 
    to be addressed."  

    In plain language "Based on what I have learned (read or seen), what is the problem I need to fix? What
    is the first thing I need to do?"


Decide

    The root of the problem having been identified, the next step is to choose what action(s) needs 
    to be taken to fix the problem.  When doing this consider:

    -How complex is the problem?
    -What tools do I have at my disposal?
    -How much time do I have to fix it?
    -What is my plan (my list of steps) to fix the problem?


Act
