One of the most important parts in figuring out what you need to do, is to figure out what questions you need to ask.


Exploratory questions to ask when trying to figure out how to do something:

1. What are you trying to do?
2. What do you need to get, to do what you need to do?
3. How do you get, what you need to get?
4. In what context, what technogies etc, do you need to search by?


To prevent yourself from getting stuck in a loop you should write down these questions and the answers to these questions.

The act of writing it down will allow you to realize when you keep asking the same questions.
